=============================

By default, the Trellix AUDIT plugin for MySQL* is named "AUDIT" and
that is the name you should use when installing the plugin with the SQL
"INSTALL PLUGIN" command.

It is the "AUDIT" name that provides the "audit_" prefix to the plugin's
various configuration variables.

In order to avoid conflict with other vendors' auditing plugins whose
names may start with "audit" (such as MySQL's "audit_log" plugin) it
is possible to change the name of the Trellix plugin.  The steps are
as follows:

1. If you're currently using the Trellix plugin, unload it.

2. Edit the /usr/bin/mysqld_safe shell script (using the correct location
for your system). For MySQL 5.7.9, look for the eval_log_error() function.
Before the line that says:

	eval "$cmd"

add a line like this:

	export MCAFEE_AUDIT_PLUGIN_NAME=TRELLIX # use any name you want

You can use any name you like, "TRELLIX" is just an example.

For other MySQL versions, determine where the mysqld daemon is actually
started, and set the environment variable right before that.

3. After restarting MySQL, you will need to load the plugin using the
new name. From the MySQL client:

	install plugin TRELLIX soname 'libaudit_plugin.so';

and/or from /etc/my.cnf:

	[mysqld]
	plugin-load=TRELLIX=libaudit_plugin.so

Once you've done that, you must remember that the names of ALL the
configuration variables will start with the lowercase version of the
name you've chosen. For example, "trellix_json_log_file" instead of
"audit_json_log_file".

If you previously had various "audit_XXX" variables set in your
/etc/my.cnf file, you will need to rename them! Otherwise MySQL will
fail to start, with an error about unknown variables.

That's it!  Good luck.
